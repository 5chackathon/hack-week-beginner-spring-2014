# Hack Week Spring 2014 - To-Do List

This application is built for the beginner division of Hack Week. It is a simple
to-do list app written in JavaScript (using [jQuery]) that allows a user to
enter tasks, check them off, and delete them. The app uses HTML5 localStorage
to persist across sessions.

## Installation

Good news: as long as you are using a [modern browser], there is no installation
necessary!

To edit the files, any text editor will work. We recommend you download and
install [Sublime Text 2].

## Running the App
You can run the app [here][demo]. If you'd like the run the application locally,
clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.
